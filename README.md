# Grievance-Redressal-System
Grievance Redressal System
This project was made under Smart India Hackathon.
This is the portal where Colleges/Uiversities can file a grievance and the Regulatory Authority under UGC will solve the grievance.
   Features:
   1) Appreciation for Regulatory Authorities
   2) User biased UI of the Website
   3) Fastracking the grievance after it's deadline.
